<h2>Mission 1 - Secure Your Star System</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Click on Map - the map will show you your home planet</li>

    <li>Pinch zoom out to see your home system and a few other planets.</li>

    <li>Single click on planet to open planet detail window</li>

    <li>Click on "Make Factory" to order a factory.</li>

    <li>In single player mode, the game will automatically finish the turn for your and let the
        enemy do their turn.
    </li>

    <li>Zoom into your home planet and click on the factory</li>

    <li>Make 5 pods and 1 cruiser. Click on each ship in turn and set the pods destination to the
        other planets in your system. You need to select a destination in the dropdown.
    </li>

    <li>Mission Success: Population on all planets. Armed ships (i.e. cruiser) around all planets.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mission 2 - Explore Other Systems. Exterminate the enemy.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Zoom out all the way to see more star systems. If you turn on Hyper-Sensors in options, you
        will soon see other ships from other races. They are not friendly.
    </li>

    <li>Make cruisers and send them to the closest other system as defense. The cruisers will shoot
        down pods and enemy cruisers once they are in reach.
    </li>

    <li>Follow up with a few pods and start populating another star system. Once you have population
        on a planet, you can build a factory there and build cruisers locally.
    </li>

    <li> To win this mission, you need to destroy the enemy head quarters. Send a few cruisers into
         the orbit of the enemy home world and they will take care of business.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mission 3-6 - Expand, Explore, Exploit, Exterminate</h2>
