<H3>Mission 1 - Secure Your Star System</H3>

<ul>
    <li>Click on Map - the map will show you your home planet</li>

    <li>Pinch zoom out to see your home system and a few other planets.</li>

    <li>Single click on planet to open planet detail window</li>

    <li>Click on "Make Factory" to order a factory.</li>

    <li>In single player mode, the game will automatically finish the turn for your and let the
        enemy do their turn.
    </li>

    <li>Zoom into your home planet and click on the factory</li>

    <li>Make 5 pods and 1 cruiser. Click on each ship in turn and set the pods destination to the
        other planets in your system. You need to select a destination in the dropdown.
    </li>

    <li>Mission Success: Population on all planets. Armed ships (i.e. cruiser) around all planets.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mission 2 - Explore Other Systems. Exterminate the enemy.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Zoom out all the way to see more star systems. If you turn on Hyper-Sensors in options, you
        will soon see other ships from other races. They are not friendly.
    </li>

    <li>Make cruisers and send them to the closest other system as defense. The cruisers will shoot
        down pods and enemy cruisers once they are in reach.
    </li>

    <li>Follow up with a few pods and start populating another star system. Once you have population
        on a planet, you can build a factory there and build cruisers locally.
    </li>

    <li> To win this mission, you need to destroy the enemy head quarters. Send a few cruisers into
         the orbit of the enemy home world and they will take care of business.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mission 3-6 - Expand, Explore, Exploit, Exterminate</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Good luck commander!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Two Player Pass and Play Mode</h2>

<p>The game allows two players to play against each other by passing the device back and forth. </p>

<p>To speed up the game, players need not pass after every action. Players can play a few turns
   ahead (currently ~10). If e.g. player 1 plays 5 turns ahead, they will automatically skip the
   next 5 turns. That means after player 2 played their first turn action, the game will
   automatically finish the first turn, and player 2 gets to play again. This goes on until player 2
   finished the fifth turn. At that point, they can pass the device back, or play ahead on their
   own. </p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hyper Sensors - show you all ships anywhere in the universe. Turned off, you can only see
        enemy ships if they are in the same system as you.
    </li>
    <li>Show Perf Stats - Displays various performance related stats.</li>
    <li>Show Race Stats - Displays stats about each races in the Universe.</li>
    <li>Show Click Targets - Displays the circle that registers clicks.</li>
    <li>Show Continuous Do Button - Display Fast Forward button that lets you automatically skip
        your turns until you press it again. While pressed, go to the map and zoom all the way out
        to see other races' ships exploring. Beware of the beetles.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ul>
    <li>What about feature X? <br> Check out the <A
            href="https://github.com/perrochon/gb/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">road map</a>
    </li>

    <li>Why don't my ships shoot at enemy ships passing through a star system? <br> It may look like
        they fly through the system, but they are way above or below in the galactic planet. One way
        to tell if a Pod is in-system is to watch it's trail. If it's straight, it may be heading
        elsewhere. If it curves toward a planet then it's in-system. Another way to tell is by
        looking closely at the color. Deep space ships are more muted than in-system.
    </li>

    <li>What are the circles around some ships? <br> An experimental feature shows click targets. If
        it has a circle, you can click it. You can toggle this in options (Show Click Targets)
    </li>

    <li>What's up with the graphics? <br> All graphics assets are currently place holders. The ship
        and race pictures have been drawn by a local aspiring artist. If you are a graphics designer
        and have cycles to spare, feel free to reach out to me.
    </li>

    <li>What is the background <br> The background is <a
            href="https://spacetelescope.org/images/heic0601a/">Hubble's picture of the Orion
                                                                Nebula.</a> Hubble took pictures of
        Andromeda, too. But Orion is more dramatic.
    </li>

    <li>Why is there a GB on some screens? <br> It's a reference to Galactic Bloodshed, an 80/90
        online multi-user 4X space themed game.
