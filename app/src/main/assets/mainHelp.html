<h1>Two Player Pass and Play Mode</h1>

<p>The game allows two players to play against each other by passing the device back and forth. </p>

<p>To speed up the game, players need not pass after every action. Players can play a few turns
   ahead (currently ~10). If e.g. player 1 plays 5 turns ahead, they will automatically skip the
   next 5 turns. That means after player 2 played their first turn action, the game will
   automatically finish the first turn, and player 2 gets to play again. This goes on until player 2
   finished the fifth turn. At that point, they can pass the device back, or play ahead on their
   own. </p>

    <li>What about feature X? <br> Check out the <A
            href="https://github.com/perrochon/gb/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">road map</a>.
    </li>

    <li>Why don't my ships shoot at enemy ships passing through a star system? <br> It may look like
        they fly through the system, but they are way above or below in the galactic planet. One way
        to tell if a Pod is in-system is to watch it's trail. If it's straight, it may be heading
        elsewhere. If it curves toward a planet then it's in-system. Another way to tell is by
        looking closely at the color. Deep space ships are more muted than in-system.

    <li>What are the circles around some ships? <br> An experimental feature shows click targets. If
        it has a circle, you can click it. You can toggle this in options (Show Click Targets)
    </li>

    <li>What's up with the graphics? <br> All graphics assets are currently place holders. The ship
        and race pictures have been drawn by a local aspiring artist. If you are a graphics designer
        and have cycles to spare, feel free to reach out to me.

    <li>What is the background <br> The background is <a
            href="https://spacetelescope.org/images/heic0601a/">Hubble's picture of the Orion
                                                                Nebula.</a> Hubble took pictures of
        Andromeda, too. But Orion is more dramatic.
    </li>

    <li>Why is there a GB on some screens? <br> It's a reference to Galactic Bloodshed, an 80/90
        online multi-user 4X space themed game.
